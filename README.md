## Some interesting points about tests

### Tests should give you confidence that you arent shipping broken software

### 3 steps: red - will see your test failing, green - you write the dumbest code to make the test pass, refactor - refactor your code that make the test pass to a more smart code

### Black box testing

### HOw can i know what i need to test? the answer is: Does anyone care about this if it changes? If the answer is yes, do the test, if not, no need for a test

### TDD lets you write robust tests, not too many and not too few.

### TDD encourages refactors, which lead to better software desgin. With tdd we create a much deeper conection between code and tests

### Your sofware contract is infility more important than the way you implement it
